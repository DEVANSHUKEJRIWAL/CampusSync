CampusSync - Campus Event Management System (CEMS)

CampusSync is a full-stack web application designed to centralize event discovery, registration, and management for universities. It features a modern React frontend, a high-performance Go backend, and a robust PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker.

🚀 Features Implemented

This project implements a complete Event Lifecycle Management system:

🔐 Authentication & Security

OIDC Integration: Secure login via Auth0 (Google/GitHub).

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Distinct permissions for Admins, Organizers, and Members.

Secure API: Middleware validation for JWT tokens on all protected endpoints.

📅 Event Management

CRUD Operations: Organizers can create, edit, and cancel events.

Visibility Control: Support for Public (open to all) and Private (invite-only) events.

Automated Lifecycle: Background Go routines automatically update event status (UPCOMING -> IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETED) based on time.

🎟️ Registration Engine

Capacity Logic: Enforces attendee limits securely using database transactions.

Waitlist System: Automatically queues users when an event is full.

Automatic Promotion: If a spot opens (via cancellation), the system automatically promotes the next waitlisted user and notifies them.

Conflict Detection: Prevents double-booking.

👥 Organizer Tools

Manage Attendees: View list of registered and waitlisted users.

CSV Export: Download attendee data for external use.

Bulk Invitations: Upload .csv files to invite hundreds of users to private events instantly.

Manual Invitations: Invite specific users by email.

🔍 User Experience

Dual Views: Switch between List View and a visual Calendar View (Monthly/Weekly).

Search & Filter: Real-time filtering by event title, description, or location.

My Schedule: Dedicated dashboard for users to track their registrations and status.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript, CSS Modules, React Big Calendar.

Backend: Go (Golang) 1.22, Standard Library (net/http), lib/pq driver.

Database: PostgreSQL 15.

Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose.

Auth: Auth0 (OpenID Connect).

📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker Desktop (running)

Git

⚙️ Configuration (Auth0)

Note: To run this project successfully, you must provide valid Auth0 credentials.

Frontend Config: Open frontend/src/main.tsx and update:

const domain = "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN";
const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
const audience = "http://localhost:8080";


Backend Config: Open backend/cmd/api/main.go and update:

auth0Domain := "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN"
auth0Audience := "http://localhost:8080"


🏃‍♂️ How to Run

This project is fully Dockerized for easy setup.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd CampusSync


2. Start the Application

Run the following command in the root directory:

docker-compose up --build


This will build the Go Backend, the React Frontend, and spin up the PostgreSQL database.

3. Access the App

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5173

👮 Admin Setup (First Run)

By default, all new users are created with the "Member" role. To unlock Organizer/Admin features, you must manually promote your first user via the database.

Log in to the app via the browser.

Open a new terminal window.

Run the following command to promote yourself to Admin:

docker exec -i cems_db psql -U postgres -d cems -c "UPDATE users SET role='Admin' WHERE email='YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com';"


(Replace YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com with the email you used to log in).

Refresh the browser. You will now see the Admin Console and Create Event options.

🧪 Testing Specific Features

Testing the Waitlist

Create an event with Capacity: 1.

Register with User A. (Status: Registered).

Log in with User B (incognito/different browser) and register. (Status: Waitlisted).

As User A, cancel your registration.

User B will automatically be promoted to Registered. Check the backend logs for the email notification!

Testing Private Events

Create an event with Visibility: Private.

Try to join as a normal user (Access Denied).

As the organizer, use the Invite or Bulk CSV button to invite the user's email.

Try to join again (Success).
